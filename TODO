* If the -b flag is used, and the system put to sleep, but then the user
  resumes it with the battery still low, it will go to sleep again. This
  type of tug-of-war with the user isn't nice. It would be better to only
  go to sleep the first time the battery goes low, then never again until
  it gets higher again. Hmm.
