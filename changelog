================
(C) 2000-2008 Joey Hess <joeyh@kitenet.net>
(C) 2017 Toni Uhlig <matzeton@googlemail.com>


VERSION 2.10
    * Replaced file based ipc with modern POSIX shared memory / POSIX mutex.
    * Bugfixes including a memory leak, wrong acpi battery count if more than
      one battery present
    * Coverity issues fixed


VERSION 2.05
  CHANGES:
    * Stop building with flash-in-the-pan HAL. Instead update acpi interface to
      use /sys/class/power_supply. Note that this needs acpica_version 20011018.
      Closes: #613169, #678966 (Patch developed by Andrew Shadura.)
    * Orphaned the package.
    * Add UPower support.
      Use Debhelper 9, so we can have hardening flags automatically.


VERSION 1.13
  CHANGES:
    * Avoid crash by ignoring high irqs greater than 254 (assumption is these will
      not be irqs we care about). Thanks, Jeff Strunk.
    * Debhelper 7, minimal rules file.
    *Update copyright file.


VERSION 1.12
  CHANGES:
    * Write status back out to control file when resume from manual sleep
      causes sleeping to be re-enabled, so that sleepctl will see the correct
      status in this case. Closes: #501708
