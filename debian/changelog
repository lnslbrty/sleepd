  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Stop building with flash-in-the-pan HAL. Instead update acpi
    interface to use /sys/class/power_supply.
    Note that this needs acpica_version 20011018.
    Closes: #613169, #678966
    (Patch developed by Andrew Shadura.)
  * Orphaned the package.

  [ Andrew Shadura ]

    fewer resources. Thanks, Jeff Strunk

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Sep 2009 21:36:06 -0400

sleepd (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Jeff Strunk contributed support for monitoring /dev/input/event*
    files, to better support USB keyboards etc. Closes: #147678
    This is now used by default, in addition to checking interrupts.
  * Jeff also added support for checking the utmp for idle times,
    for checking the system's load average, and for monitoring
    a network device for activity. None done by default.
  * Use pm-suspend, rather than hibernate --force, to put the system
    to sleep by default.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 26 May 2009 17:49:55 -0400

sleepd (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Avoid crash by ignoring high irqs greater than 254
    (assumption is these will not be irqs we care about).
    Thanks, Jeff Strunk.
  * Debhelper 7, minimal rules file.
  * Update copyright file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 May 2009 14:34:49 -0400

sleepd (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Write status back out to control file when resume from manual sleep causes
    sleeping to be re-enabled, so that sleepctl will see the correct status
    in this case. Closes: #501708

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 09 Oct 2008 16:22:40 -0400

sleepd (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tweak acpi/hal backend chosing logic to deal with being started before
    hal on a system without acpi power info. Closes: #494912
  * Make init script depend on hal and move init script sequence number to
    after hal for new installs. Both changes avoid warning message in syslog,
    but the change above makes it ok if old installs don't follow suite.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Aug 2008 22:58:02 -0400

sleepd (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * If sleepd is only being used to sleep on low battery, avoid reading
    /proc/interrupts at all.
  * Avoid sleeping if the battery is absent.
    (This includes simplehal reporting it as absent because hal has died.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jun 2008 19:11:45 -0400

sleepd (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Magic header file reordering to work around the disgusting

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Feb 2008 15:08:55 -0500

sleepd (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use hibernate as the default sleep command when using hal, same as for
    raw acpi.
  * Make init script depend on dbus, to avoid sleepd getting confused
    if dbus is stopped.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2008 01:03:51 -0500

sleepd (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't spew error messages if optional hal properties are not available.
  * Add hal to recommends.
  * Support reconnecting to hal if the connection is closed, as happens
    if the hal is restarted.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Feb 2008 22:29:58 -0500

sleepd (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only register the init script to stop sleepd at runlevel 1. The general
    process killer will handle killing it cleanly in runlevels 0 and 6.
  * Run stop script at point 80 instead of 20, to be symmetric with the point
    it's started.
  * These changes will only take effect for new installs of the package,
    to avoid clobbering local changes.
  * Merge HAL support from wmbattery. Support for the old kernel interfaces
    (APM, ACPI, etc) is still present, but to use new interfaces such
    2.6.24's /sys/class/power_adapter, you'll have to have dbus and hal.

sleepd (1.3.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct issue with the statically allocated string returned by
    get_acpi_value that caused it to only look at last full capacity and never
    really at design capacity. 

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Dec 2007 22:26:50 -0500

sleepd (1.3.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Guard some divisions against division by zero. I've never seen that
    happen and can't reproduce it, but see #454766.
  * Merge acpi change from procmeter3: Limit string length when reading from
    /proc/.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Feb 2006 18:42:35 -0500

sleepd (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * On acpi systems, default to "hibernate --force" if no sleep command
    is specified.
  * No longer go to sleep while on AC power unless --ac-unused is set.
    Closes: #100087
  * Recommend hibernate | apmd.
  * Adjusted some bits like the init script that claimed it was APM specific.
  * Fix path to control file on sleepctl man page.
  * Patch based on a patch by Wolfgang Karall to add a --hibernate-command
    option, which can be used to specify a different command to run when
    the battery is low vs when sleeping due to inactivity.
  * Treat AC plug/unplug events as activity. Closes: #348386
  * Allow specifying a --battery number of 0, which was previously invalid.
    May be useful on hardware where the acpi battery calculations fall below
    zero when the battery is very depleted, to make the system sleep at the
    very last minute. This is experimental.
  * Merge in changes from procmeter3's version of acpi.c, made by Andrew M.
    Bishop, that avoid the ugly chdir to /proc/acpi and add a bit of error
    checking. Now fully synced with procmeter3 3.4d and wmbattery 2.24.
  * Patch from Stephen Gildea to acpi.c to deal with his laptop, which
    sometimes reports the battery is discharging when when it's plugged in,
    so discharge status cannot be used to imply offline status.
  * Slightly modified patch to still avoid calling on_ac_power() in
    obvious cases.
  * Also, logic error fix to the zero batteries implies it must be plugged in
    code.
  * Rewrote package description.
  * Make arch all, since libapm-dev is now available on all arches.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Jan 2006 17:57:34 -0500

  * Fix init script so restart works if PARAMS includes quotes.
    Thanks, Luigi Bai. Closes: #311406
  * Sync acpi code with wmbattery 2.22, to avoid the ugly chdir to /proc/acpi
    and add a bit of error checking.

sleepd (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run PARAMS through one extra variable expansion in the start-stop-daemon
    call to allow it to contain multiple settings, and quoted strings such
    as --sleep-command 'apm -S'

sleepd (1.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only warn once about no keyboard or mouse irqs, not every update.
    Closes: #226389, although it still probably has 2.6 kernel issues.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jan 2004 20:05:06 -0500

sleepd (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recognise i8042 in /proc/interrupts as a keyboard/mouse. 2.5 kernels
    report by chipset apparently. Update documentation with more detials.
    Closes: #193183

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 13 May 2003 17:07:40 -0400

sleepd (1.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

sleepd (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 May 2002 11:32:37 -0400

sleepd (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACPI support. Have to use software suspend to sleep though (unless you're
    Linus or something), and so there is some manual tweaking required.
  * Changed the default check period to 10 seconds, as ACPI is a mite more
    expensive, and anything under a minute should really be fine.
  * Support use of -b w/o -U flag.
  * Support -u 0 to disable idle checking.
  * Made -s actually work.
  * debhelper v4

sleepd (1.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed this package and the daemon from apm-sleep to sleepd,
    after observing that apmsleep is a program in the apm package.
    Anyway, daemons should end in 'd'.
  * Remove any sleepd.ctl on purge.
  * The magic in the preinst should transition both conffiles transparently
    to the admin.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Nov 2001 18:30:39 -0500

apm-sleep (1.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

apm-sleep (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed two typos that prevented it from ever sleeping except in low
    power situations.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jun 2001 21:30:35 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the apm-sleep control file to /var/run/, so it is removed on
    reboots. I want the control data to persist accross daemon restarts,
    but not reboots.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2001 20:37:33 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -b flag to make the system go to sleep if the battery gets low.

apm-sleep (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

apm-sleep (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added sleepctl program.
  * Removed bogus changelog entry that was meant for wmbattery (so _that's_
    where the mysterious missing changelog entry went!).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jun 2001 23:35:06 -0400

apm-sleep (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

apm-sleep (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * I discovered that apm-sleep would run before X or gpm were started, and
    there would be no mouse irq in the list, so it would not autoprobe it.
    The fix is to make it autoprobe for keyboard and mouse every time
    through the main loop. I do this with pretty little additional
    overhead, really. It should also make autoprobing work if a device is
    connected or enabled or whatever when the daemon is running (I'm
    thinking USB..) Closes: #80173

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2000 17:32:05 -0800

apm-sleep (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Stephen Rothwell <sfr@linuxcare.com.au> to:
    - add ac-unused option
    - add some paramater checking
    - add check-time option
  * Added a new TODO item to replace the one Steven did.
  * Build-depends on apmd now.
  * Modified above patch a bit. -U 0 will disable sleep completly
    when on wall power, and if -U is not specified, it defaults to
    using whatever the regular suspend time is.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 22:59:12 -0800
